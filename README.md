My project is a simple calulator to give boardfootage.  Inputs are thickness in inches, width in inches, and length in inches.  These three inputs are multiplied together, then divided by 144 and this gives the user their boardfootage when purchasing lumber.  There's also a menu at the top.  One menu item will link to the website of the lumber yard where I work, and the other menu item links to a page that shows the cost per boardfoot for each species of wood.  There's currently a drop down menu for species selection, but it doesn't currently do anything and isn't currently required. I eventually would like to have JavaScript that could use the species selected to calculate price too.

Required Features:

1. CSS feature: A navigation bar that expands and collapses for different screens. 

2. JavaScript feature: Use JavaScript to calculate boardfootage and display it in my html.

3. JavaScript feature: Alert pop-up if anything other than a number is entered into thickness, width, or length fields.

Special Instructions - I used the app Scout to compile my css if that makes any difference when reviewing my project.
