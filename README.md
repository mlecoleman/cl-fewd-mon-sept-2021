My project is a simple calulator to give boardfootage.  Inputs are thickness in inches, width in inches, and length in inches.  These three inputs are multiplied together, then divided by 144 and this gives the user their boardfootage when purchasing lumber.  There's also a short menu.  One menu item will link to the website of the lumberyard where I work, and the other menu item would eventually link to a page that would allow updates to the pricing of each species.  There's currently a drop down menu for species selection, but it doesn't currently do anything and isn't currently required.  I might get that done before the project is done, but that might also be something to work on in the future!

Required Features:

1. CSS feature: I have a navigation bar that expands and collapses for different screens. 

2. JavaScript feature: Attempting to use JavaScript to calculate boardfootage and display it in my html.

3. 

Special Instructions - I used the app Scout to compile my css if that makes any difference when reviewing my project.
